Task Two (Group Discussion):

Group #7: Ethan Miller, Jacob Janes, Dylan Lathrum, David Wang


1. WHEN are requirements done in an Agile method such as Scrum or XP?
    Requirements are set initially to construct user stories from; this can change as you present to the client but the project 
    is generally laid out early on. Changes/creation of tasks would occur after each sprint when setting up the next

2. HOW is this different than traditional software lifecycle models such as Waterfall or Spiral?
    Those are much less flexible & have heavy EARLY requirement acquisition. They'll be initially much slower and struggle with 
    later adaptation.

3. DISCUSS: given your answers to 1 and 2, do you believe the maxim of an exponential cost curve as shown in your notes?
    If we adopt traditional software lifecycles, we're more likely to become trapped in said cost curve. The advantage with Agile
    methods is that adaptation will help prevent catches like that since we can be more felxible.
